## Astro Blog

import { Steps, Code, Tabs } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This week I learned how to build a fully functional blog using Astro.js and React components.

### Highlights

<Steps>

1. First, I installed Astro.js and set up a new project.

   ```js
   npm create astro@latest
   ```

2. Then I added a pages folder to display my individual pages.
3. Next, I added a components folder to reuse some components such as the Navbar and Footer.

4. Next I added a layouts folder to create a consistent layout for my pages.

5. However, It was hard to override the layout styles such as for h1. But with the help of Astro's `:global` directive, I was able to override the styles.

6. Next, I added dynamic page routing to display pages that match a given tag given by clicking a URL. I noticed this would be useful in getting a blog by id as well.

7. I then integrated React to add hydrated pages in my project. I added a react component to display a custom greeting message that can change upon a button click.

8. Next, I tried to copy https://igihe.com/, a famous Rwandan news website, by slightly modifying my project's CSS styles. 

9. Finally, I deployed my project to Netlify and it is live at: https://pacis-astro-blog.netlify.app/
